# iReady-Breaker
iReady is awful. It's the worst education tool anyone could ever use. This code is designed to skip through iready lessons.

# How to use
Simply open an iReady lesson, use ctrl + shift + i or "inspect element" to open developer tools, click on "console" and paste the code from [main.js](main.js) into the console and hit enter. Then, refresh the page and the lesson should be skipped.

Note that so far, it only works on math lessons, not reading or quizzes.
